 When displaying a table with all orders, it is essential to provide users with relevant information about each
order so that they can quickly understand its status and details. Here's a list of key data points you may want to
consider for your "Orders" table:

1. **Order ID** - A unique identifier for each order, usually generated automatically when the order is placed.
This number helps users easily reference their orders.
2. **User Name (or User Email)** - The name or email address of the user who placed the order. You can either
display the full name if available or just the email to maintain privacy.
3. **Order Date** - The date when the order was created. This information is helpful for both users and
administrators as it shows when an order was made and can help with tracking deliveries.
4. **Total Price** - The sum of all the pizza items in the order, including any applicable taxes or additional
fees.
5. **Order Status** - Indicates the current status of the order (e.g., Pending, Preparing, On Delivery,
Delivered). This helps users understand where their order is in the process and what they can expect next.
6. **Payment Method** - The payment method chosen by the user when placing the order. For example, "Credit Card,"
"PayPal," or "Cash on delivery." This information helps both users and administrators identify any potential
issues with payments.
7. **Address (Shipping/Delivery Address)** - Display the address where the order should be delivered. This is
crucial for proper routing of deliveries and ensuring that orders are sent to the correct location.
8. **Order Notes** - Any notes or special instructions added by the user during checkout, such as "Leave at the
door" or "No onions." This information helps your staff prepare the order correctly and ensures a smooth delivery
process.
9. **Items in Order (Product Name, Quantity)** - List the pizzas included in each order, along with their
quantities. Users can quickly see what they ordered, and administrators can verify that orders are being fulfilled
correctly.
10. **Tracking Information** - If applicable, display any tracking information or links for users to track their
orders. This is especially important if your pizza site uses third-party delivery services like Uber Eats,
Grubhub, or DoorDash.

By including these key data points in your "Orders" table, you'll help users and administrators efficiently manage
and understand each order. You can customize this layout to fit the specific needs of your pizza site, ensuring a
positive user experience.
