... e layout of the table be? like if they ordered multiple pizzas how would that work?
 To design an effective database structure for managing orders in your pizza site, you might want to consider
using a relational database (SQL) and creating tables as follows:

1. **Users**
    - UserID (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
    - FirstName
    - LastName
    - Email
    - PhoneNumber
    - Address
    - CreatedAt
    - UpdatedAt

2. **Orders**
    - OrderID (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
    - UserID (Foreign Key, references Users(UserID))
    - OrderDate
    - TotalPrice
    - Status (e.g., Pending, Preparing, On Delivery, Delivered)
    - CreatedAt
    - UpdatedAt

3. **Pizzas**
    - PizzaID (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
    - Name
    - Description
    - BasePrice
    - ImageUrl
    - CreatedAt
    - UpdatedAt

4. **OrderItems**
    - OrderItemID (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
    - OrderID (Foreign Key, references Orders(OrderID))
    - PizzaID (Foreign Key, references Pizzas(PizzaID))
    - Quantity
    - SubtotalPrice
    - CreatedAt
    - UpdatedAt

This structure allows you to have multiple orders for a single user and multiple order items for a single order.
Each order item belongs to one pizza, and each pizza can be included in multiple order items.

In the frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), you would then display the orders table as follows:

- **Order ID** - Display the unique identifier for the order.
- **User Name** - Display the first name and last name of the user who placed the order.
- **Order Date** - Show the date when the order was created.
- **Total Price** - Sum up the total price of all pizza items in the order.
- **Status** - Display the current status of the order (e.g., Pending, Preparing, On Delivery, Delivered).
- **View Order Details** - A button that leads to a separate page displaying all items in this particular order
along with other relevant details like addresses and tracking information (if applicable).

You can customize this structure to fit your specific needs and requirements. Good luck building your pizza site!
